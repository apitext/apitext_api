## what is apitext?</h3>

> Apitext is a student built prototype RESTful Application Programing Interface (API) for TEI-XML Transcriptions. Once uploaded to a TEI-XML folder on a website, it exposes a series of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI). By using these identifier endpoints, a user can retrieve specific information from a TEI-XML file.

> Currently, our prototype only manages one TEI-XML file and only supports URI requests from the same domain as the API itself. To find out about future development plans, please see our about the project" section.
